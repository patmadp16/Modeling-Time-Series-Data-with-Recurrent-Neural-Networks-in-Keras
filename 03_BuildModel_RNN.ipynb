The **recurrent connections** in the RNN architecture provide visibility of not just the current data sample, but also the network's previous hidden state. A recurrent network with a feedback loop can be visualized as multiple copies of a neural network, with the output of one serving as an input to the next in time. An RNN is particularly useful when a sequence of data is being processed to make a classification decision or regression estimate, though it can also be used on non-sequential data. Recurrent neural networks are typically used to solve tasks related to time series data. "

In practice, RNNs are limited to looking back only a few steps due to what is called the [**vanishing gradient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem) problem.  In essence, during the training process, as errors are backpropagated through time, inputs from previous time steps get exponentially down-weighted and are eventually driven to zero (i.e. vanish).\n",

LSTMs solve the vanishing gradient problem by augmenting the network with recurrent gates called [**forget gates**](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/gers02a/gers02a.pdf). A defining feature of the LSTM is that it prevents backpropagated errors from vanishing (or exploding) and instead allows errors to flow backwards through unlimited numbers of \"virtual layers\" unfolded in time. That is, the LSTM can learn \"[very deep](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7828)\" tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands or even millions of discrete time steps ago. Problem-specific LSTM-like topologies can be [evolved](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04277-5_76) and can work even when signals contain long delays or have a mix of low and high frequency components."

This forces the network to leverage information contained in potentially covariate variables.  For example, a particular sample Heart Rate may be ‘dropped’, but a combination of systolic/diastolic blood pressure and breathing rate may provide a reasonable proxy.\n",

In practice this tends to lead to more stable networks.\n",

        "Both PIM2 and PRISM3 are scoring systems for ICU and surgical patients.  Models that predict the risk of death of groups of patients admitted to intensive care are available for adult, pediatric and neonatal intensive care. By adjusting for differences in severity of illness and diagnosis, these models can be used to compare the standard of care between units and within units over time. They can also be used to compare different methods of organising intensive care. Estimating mortality risk is also an important component of comparing groups of patients in research trials.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) was originally developed as a simple model that requires variables collected at the time of admission to intensive care. The original PIM was developed predominantly in Australian units; in the first report only one of the eight units was actually available in the United Kingdom. The PIM2 is a revised mortality index using a more recent data set from 14 intensive care units, eight in Australia, four in the UK, and two in New Zealand. In the analysis for PIM2, 20,787 patient admissions of children less than 16 years of age were included. Since PIM2 estimates mortality risk from data readily available at the time of ICU admission it is therefore suitable for continuous monitoring of the quality of paediatric intensive care. PIM2 uses the first value of each variable measured within the period from the time of first contact to one hour after arrival in the ICU.  If information is missing (e.g. Base Excess is not measured) PIM2 records zero, except for systolic blood pressure, which should be recorded as 120. All consecutive admissions are included.  See [Slater et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12541154) for full details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, the Pediatric Risk of Mortality ([PRISM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3048900)) score was originally developed around 1988 from the Physiologic Stability Index ([PSI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6728571)) to reduce the number of variables required for pediatric ICU mortality risk assessment, from 34 (in the PSI) to 14 and to obtain an objective weighting of the remaining variables.  Here <a href=\"http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(97)70065-9/abstract\">PRISM3</a> is an updated version of the scoring system published in 1996 which has several improvements over the original model. However, it is only available under licence and is not widely used outside of the United States.  The PRISM3 score has 17 physiologic variables subdivided into 26 ranges. The variables determined most predictive of mortality were minimum systolic blood pressure, abnormal pupillary reflexes, and stupor/coma."
